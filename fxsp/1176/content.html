    <h2>About The Players...</h2>
	<div class="first"><h3>Derek Carr<br /><span>QB - Fresno State</span></h3>
<p>Carr might have the strongest arm of any QB in the Draft. His excellent Pro Day turned a lot of heads, since he was in the hospital the night before </p>
</div>
	<div><h3>Teddy Bridgewater<br /><span>QB - Louisville</span></h3>
<p>The 6-foot-3, 195-pound quarterback has an excellent career at Louisville playing for task-master Charlie Strong. His duel-threat skills could have a huge impact early.</p>
</div>
	<div><h3>Johnny Manziel<br /><span>QB - Texas A&amp;M</span></h3>
<p>After being the first freshman to win the Heisman Trophy, Manziel followed it up by another stellar campaign. His free-lancing ability makes him a big play waiting to happen.</p>
</div>
	<div><h3>Blake Bortles<br /><span>QB - UCF</span></h3>    
<p>Looking for the prototypical quarterback, who fits the mold of other notable Pro Bowlers? Look no further than Bortles. The 6-foot-5, 232lbs QB has the size to endure NFL-sized hits.</p>
</div>
	<div class="last"><h3>Zach Mettenberger<br /><span>QB - LSU</span></h3>
<p>As a big, strong-armed prospect and a prototypical dropback passer, Mettenberger is a throwback. While his lack mobility is a negative, he can make any throw.</p>
