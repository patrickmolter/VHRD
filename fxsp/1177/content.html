    <h2>About The Teams...</h2>
	<div class="first"><h3>Jacksonville<br />Jaguars</h3>
<p>The Jags resisted the temptation to take the splashy Johnny Football and took the solid Blake Bortles instead. Then then got two steals in Marquise Lee and Allen Robinson in Round 2.</p>
</div>
	<div><h3>Cleveland<br />Browns</h3>
<p>Johnny Football is now Johnny Cleveland. But the Browns also got a freak athlete in CB Justin Gilbert and a road paver in Joel Bitonio. And don’t sleep on Terrance West or Pierre Desir.</p>
</div>
	<div><h3>Tampa Bay<br />Buccaneers</h3>
<p>The Bucs boosted their offense by taking a great pass catching threesome in Vincent Jackson, Austin Seferian-Jenkins and Mike Evans. RB Charles Sims is a good addition to the fireworks.</p>
</div>
	<div><h3>Minnesota<br />Vikings</h3>
<p>Toddy Bridgewater might be the most underrated player in the Draft and will immediately compete for the starting job. Anthony Barr is a perfect pass rusher in Mike Zimmer’s system.</p>
</div>
	<div class="last"><h3>Houston<br />Texans</h3>
<p>If you like athleticism, Jadeveon Clowney is your guy. If he plays hard, he could be one of the greats. Xavier Su’o-Filo is a mauler and QB Tom Savage is a QB that has a lot of potential. </p>
