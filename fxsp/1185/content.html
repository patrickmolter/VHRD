    <h2>About The Teams...</h2>
	<div class="first"><h3>Carolina</h3>
<p>Last year’s surprise team, Carolina looks to improve on its 12-4 record. Behind emerging star QB Cam Newton, the Panthers hope to cement a permanent spot among the NFL’s elite.</p>
</div>
	<div><h3>Denver</h3>
<p>Peyton Manning got the Broncos to the Super Bowl last year before falling to Seattle. This year, Denver looks to take the next step by adding DeMarcus Ware to the its defense.</p>
</div>
	<div><h3>New England</h3>
<p>If you have Bill Belichick as your coach and Tom Brady as your QB you’ll always be a threat to win the Super Bowl. This year the Patriots have added CB Darrelle Revis to the mix.</p>
</div>
	<div><h3>San Francisco</h3>
<p>The 49ers have been a bridesmaid in the past few seasons, but Coach Jim Harbaugh leads a stout bunch. QB Colin Kaepernick, new contract in hand, might be ready to win it all.</p>
</div>
	<div class="last"><h3>Seattle</h3>
<p>There’s no reason to think the defending Super Bowl champs will take a step backwards. Coach Pete Carroll, QB Russell Wilson and CB Richard Sherman are ready to repeat.</p>
